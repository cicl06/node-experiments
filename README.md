Various experiments with node.js

There's nothing interesting here.
I'm just sharing this to put something on my github/so others can see what I'm learning.

I don't endorse Node.js. I'm learning it mostly to get a greater familiarity with higher-level development, especially with web-servers.

Most of these excercises are taken from "The Node Craftsman Book" by Manuel Kiessling. It's a decent text.
